Particle Life - Tom Mohr does a great job explaining it here:

This project served as a way to learn basic JS and the HTML canvas.
I implemented a 2D and 3D version greatly inspired by Tom Mohr.
I also created 2 visualizations for grid and lattice partitioning.

mess around with the dMax values - the variable that determines the
max distance at which particles can still interact.

2D: index2D and particleLifeClass2D
Visualize grid partitioning w/ wrapping using:
NearestNbr2D and gridPartitioning

3D: index3D and particleLifeClass3D
Visualize lattice partitioning w/ wrapping using:
NearestNbr3D and Draw3D
